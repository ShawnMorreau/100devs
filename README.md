I was stuck just applying for jobs through the dreaded "apply" button on websites. I didn't realize how important networking really was and it made sense since I haven't had an interview even after sending out hundreds of applications.

What is my story?
-   Started building computers for family from a young age and always questioned 'how things work'. Everything from that pinball game when internet wasn't connected to the first big game I played online 'runescape'. 
- In highschool I saw that there was a class provided to learn how to code and I jumped on it, and even had to take an online class in my final year because I had enjoyed it so much.
